# X-as-Code: Everything as Code

Website: http://x-as-code.useblocks.com/

## Usage

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Or use GitHub Codespaces and just run the devcontainer

Make sure the ubCode environment variables are available as specified here: 

## Whats inside?

### Devcontainer

- ubcode
- graphviz
- CMake

### Demo Sphinx & Sphinx-Needs Project

### Demo C++ Project

Demonstrating Codelinks & Test-Reports

### Build Scripts

The project includes several build scripts to help you build different components:

| Script | Purpose | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `./scripts/build.sh` | **Full build** | Builds documentation, C++ executable, and runs unit tests |
| `./scripts/build_app.sh` | **C++ only** | Builds the C++ project and runs tests |
| `./scripts/build_doc.sh` | **Docs only** | Builds the Sphinx + Sphinx-Needs documentation |
| `./scripts/test_with_coverage.sh` | **Tests with coverage** | Builds C++ project, runs tests, and generates code coverage report |
| `./scripts/clean.sh` | **Clean** | Removes all build artifacts |
| `./scripts/run_http_server.sh` | **Server generated HTML files** | Opens a http server and servers the generated html files. With this method you can view the generated html files also when developing in Codespaces |


#### Quick Start

For first-time setup or complete rebuild:

```shell
./scripts/build.sh
```

#### Targeted Builds

Build only the C++ application and tests:

```shell
./scripts/build_app.sh
```

Build only the documentation:

```shell
./scripts/build_doc.sh
```

Run tests with code coverage:

```shell
./scripts/test_with_coverage.sh
```

This will generate a coverage report in `src/build/coverage_html/index.html`.

Clean all build artifacts:

```shell
./scripts/clean.sh
```

> **💡 Tip**: Use `./scripts/build.sh` for your first build, then use targeted scripts for faster incremental builds during development.

#### Viewing created HTML pages

```shell
./scripts/run_http_server.sh
```

## Build with Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools needed for this project.

### Prerequisites

Before using Codespaces, you need to configure the required environment variables as Codespace secrets:

1. **Navigate to your GitHub user settings**
2. **Go to Settings → Code, planning, and automation → Codespaces**
3. **Add the following Codespace user secrets** and assign them to the correct repository:
   - `UBCODE_LICENSE_KEY`: Your ubCode license key
   - `UBCODE_LICENSE_USER`: Your registered email address

This is also described here in more detail: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-your-account-specific-secrets-for-github-codespaces

> **⚠️ Important**: These secrets are required for the ubCode extension to function properly. Without them, the extension is not working.

### Getting Started with Codespaces

1. **Open in Codespaces**
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository
   - Click the green **Code** button
   - Select the **Codespaces** tab
   - Click **Create codespace on main** (or any other branch you prefer)

2. **Automatic Setup**
   - The devcontainer will automatically install:
     - Python environment with uv package manager
     - Java (for PlantUML diagrams)
     - Graphviz (for diagram generation)
     - CMake (for C++ project builds)
     - ubCode VS Code extension
     - Python VS Code extension

3. **First Build**
   Once the codespace is ready, run the full build:
   ```shell
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

### What's Included in the Codespace

The devcontainer includes:
- **Base Image**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
- **Tools**: Git, curl, wget, and other essential CLI tools
- **Development Environment**: Pre-configured VS Code with extensions
- **Build Tools**: CMake, Graphviz, Java, uv for the complete toolchain

### Working with the Project

After the codespace starts:

1. **Build the documentation**:
   ```shell
   ./scripts/build_doc.sh
   ```

2. **Build the C++ project**:
   ```shell
   ./scripts/build_app.sh
   ```

3. **View the documentation**:
   - Open the generated HTML files using:
   ```shell
   "$BROWSER" docs/_build/html/index.html
   ```

4. **Clean build artifacts**:
   ```shell
   ./scripts/clean.sh
   ```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be available for the Codespace:

- `UBCODE_LICENSE_KEY`: Your ubCode license key (from secrets)
- `UBCODE_LICENSE_USER`: Your registered email (from secrets)

Please checkout [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-your-account-specific-secrets-for-github-codespaces#adding-a-secret) on how to add account specific secrets

With settings these variables the `ubcode.toml` file is not necessary anymore for the ubCode extension functionality.

### Alternative: Manual Environment Setup

If you prefer to set environment variables manually in the CLI (for testing or local development):

```shell
export UBCODE_LICENSE_KEY="your-license-key"
export UBCODE_LICENSE_USER="your-email@example.com"
```

### Customizing the Environment

The devcontainer configuration is defined in [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json). You can modify:

- **Additional tools**: Edit [`scripts/postCreateCommand.sh`](scripts/postCreateCommand.sh) to install more packages
- **VS Code extensions**: Add extensions to the `customizations.vscode.extensions` array
- **Environment variables**: Control installations by setting variables in the post-create script

### Benefits of Using Codespaces

- ✅ **Instant Setup**: No local dependencies required
- ✅ **Consistent Environment**: Same setup across all team members
- ✅ **Pre-configured Tools**: All necessary tools installed automatically
- ✅ **Cloud Resources**: Use GitHub's cloud infrastructure for builds
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: Your work is automatically saved
- ✅ **Secure Secrets**: License keys managed through GitHub secrets

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check environment variables**: Verify that `UBCODE_LICENSE_KEY` and `UBCODE_LICENSE_USER` are set:
   ```shell
   echo $UBCODE_LICENSE_KEY
   echo $UBCODE_LICENSE_USER
   ```

2. **Verify secrets**: Ensure the repository secrets are properly configured in GitHub

3. **Restart the codespace**: Sometimes a fresh start resolves configuration issues

4. **Check the post-create logs**: View the terminal output during setup

5. **Rebuild container**: Use Command Palette → "Codespaces: Rebuild Container"

> **💡 Tip**: Codespaces is perfect for quick contributions, testing, or when you don't want to set up the development environment locally. The automated secret management ensures a seamless experience.
